## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Main Features

- **Comprehensive Starter Pack:** New players can claim a one-time package containing cash, bank money, essential items, a personal vehicle, and a driver's license.
- **Weekly Loyalty Rewards:** Existing players who have already claimed the starter pack can return to the NPC weekly to receive random item rewards, encouraging player retention.
- **Modular Inventory Integration:** Natively supports both `qb-inventory` (default) and `ox_inventory` through a simple configuration setting.
- **Automatic Discord Logs:** Every time a starter pack is claimed, a detailed notification is sent to a designated admin channel via a Discord webhook.
- **Rules UI:** Before claiming their pack, new players must read and agree to configurable server rules.
- **Anti-Abuse System:** A solid system based on character metadata prevents players from repeatedly claiming the starter pack.
- **Easy Configuration:** Nearly every aspect (rewards, NPC, vehicle, messages) can be easily modified through the `config.lua` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  Download this script and place the `qb-starterpack` folder into your server's `resources` directory.
2.  (Optional) If you plan to use `ox_inventory`, ensure that resource is also installed.
3.  Open `config.lua` and adjust all settings to your preference (see the **Configuration** section below).
4.  Add the following line to your `server.cfg` file, making sure it is placed **after** all the required dependencies:
    ```cfg
    ensure qb-starterpack
    ```
5.  Restart your server or run `refresh; ensure qb-starterpack` in the server console. The NPC will now appear at your configured location.
